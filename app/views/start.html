    <p class="govuk-body">You can get support for your household energy bills if you have not received it automatically. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You might be able to apply for:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>£400 to help you with the rising cost of energy bills through the Energy Bills Support Scheme </li>
      <li>£100 to help you with the rising cost of alternative fuels if you are off the mains gas grid </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">You might be eligible for one or both payments.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Most people will have received these payments automatically. If you have not, you might be able to apply for one or both of these.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can apply for energy bill support if:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your household has not received the payments automatically</li>
      <li>you are applying for your main, permanent home</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="400-energy-bills-support" class="govuk-heading-m">£400 energy bills support</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The Energy Bills Support Scheme is a £400 discount for eligible households to help with their energy bills over winter 2022 to 2023. Most households will have received this automatically from their energy supplier as a monthly discount to their energy bills. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can apply for this payment if your home doesn’t have a domestic energy meter and a direct relationship with an electricity supplier. This means that you pay for energy through your landlord, housing manager, or site owner.</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>in a residential park home</li>
      <li>on a permanent Gypsy and Traveller site</li>
      <li>in a home on a heat network without an electricity meter</li>
      <li>in social or private rented accommodation which has a non-domestic energy connection</li>
      <li>in a home that is off the mains electricity or gas grid</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">You are not eligible if you:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>have a domestic energy meter in your home</li>
      <li>pay an energy supplier directly for your energy bills</li>
      <li>don't pay energy bills</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="100-alternative-fuels-payment" class="govuk-heading-m">£100 alternative fuels payment</h2>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">If you use alternative fuels to heat your home and are not connected to the mains gas grid, you are eligible for a £100 payment.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Most homes that are eligible for this payment have already received it automatically. If your home is in an area which is mainly connected to the gas grid, you might not have received this automatically. You can now apply for this payment.  </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can apply if you use alternative fuels to heat your home such as bottled gas, oil, wood and solid fuel, or are on a heat network. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can’t apply if you: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>have a connection to the mains gas grid</li>
      <li>have already received the payment automatically</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="care-home-or-supported-accomodation" class="govuk-heading-m">If you live in a care home or supported accommodation</h2>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">If you live in a care home or sheltered and supported accommodation and pay for some or part of your care fees you may also be eligible for one or both of these payments.  </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">However, you should not apply individually. Your property manager should apply on your behalf and pass on the discount.</p>
    
    <h2 id="before-you-start" class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">The council tax bill payer from your household should apply for these payments. This is so that your local council can prove you live at the address you are applying for.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If no one in your household has their name on a council tax bill, you will need to provide additional proof of address.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Examples of proof of address include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>examples</li>
      <li>go</li>
      <li>here</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you are applying for the £100 alternative fuel payment, you will need to provide proof that you use alternative fuels to heat your home in the form of a delivery note or receipt of purchase.  </p>
