    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="compliance-status">Compliance status</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We intend to make our service compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        version 2.1 AA standard. The service is currently partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. We will list non-compliant content following the accessibility audit conducted from 16 January 2023.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Wherever possible, we have taken action to fix accessibility issues with our
        service. However, certain sections of our service – we list them here – provide little or no
        options for improvement and, as such, we will not directly fix them. We believe that doing so now would be a

            burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations</a>.

        well as taking feedback from users.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Any required changes will be planned into our continous improvement work for this service
        and added to a backlog of improvement goals and prioritised according to user need and cost.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement will be updated based on any issues we identify or any
        changes we make to address any issues raised.</p>
