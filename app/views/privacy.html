    <p class="govuk-body">
      This notice is provided to meet the requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and Data
      Protection Act 2018 (DPA) to provide transparency in how we process and use personal data collected from the ‘Apply for
      energy bill support if you do not get it automatically’ service, and your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and 14 of
      the UK GDPR.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and local authorities are the independent data
      controllers for the ‘Apply for energy bill support if you do not get it automatically’ service.
    </p>  
    <p class="govuk-body">
      A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      The data
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The personal data we collect from you includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <li>bank account details to help us identify you and facilitate payment</li>
      <li>questions or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact us</li>
      <li>how you use our emails - for example whether you open them and which links you click on</li>
      <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/support/browsers">web browser</a> you used</li>
      <li>information on how you use the site, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies">using cookies</a> and page tagging techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where you provide your consent, we use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631">Google Analytics</a> cookies to collect information about how you use the service.
      This includes IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Google Analytics processes information about:
    </p>

      <li>the location of your Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">

        address anonymisation</a> feature and by removing any other personal data from the titles or URLs of the pages you visit.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        We will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would directly identify who you are.
