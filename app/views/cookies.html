            <p>Where you provide your consent, we use Google Analytics cookies to collect information about how you use the service. This includes IP addresses.</p>  
            <p>Google Analytics processes information about:</p>
            <ul>
  <li>the pages you visit on the service</li>  
  <li>how long you spend on each page</li>  
  <li>how you got to the site</li>  
  <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>  
  <li>the location of your Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>  
                </u>
<p>We make sure you cannot be directly identified by Google Analytics data. We do this by using Google Analytics’ IP address anonymisation feature and by removing any other personal data from the titles or URLs of the pages you visit.</p>   
<p>We will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would directly identify who you are.</p> 
<p>If you consent to Google Analytics cookies, we use the information collected through Google Analytics to see how you use the service and to see how well the site performs on your device.</p>  
<p>We do this to help:</p>
            <ul>
<li>make sure the service is meeting the needs of its users and make improvements</li> 
<li>make performance improvements, for example improving page load time and data usage</li>  
<li>monitor the performance of the site to identify inefficiencies and JavaScript errors</li> 
<p>The data we collect with Google Analytics cookies is transferred and stored with Google where we analyse it with Google Analytics software (Universal Analytics). We do not allow Google to use or share this data for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Data collected by Google Analytics may be transferred outside the EEA to the US for processing. No personal data is transferred and IP addresses are anonymised using Google Analytics 4. Original IPs are not stored by Google Analytics and will not be transferred out of the UK. Any parameters contained in collected URLs and any data that could lead to re-identification is removed before analysis and before any data transfers.</p>
